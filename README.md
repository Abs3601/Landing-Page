# Landing-Page Project

This is the landing page project for The Odin Project!

## First commit - Making Hero

Styling to me seems like it's very badly done, I've tried using flexbox but it isn't responsive, I know it says not to worry about that, but just lining up the two columns with the image and hero text felt like I've done it extremely poorly and hard-coded like.

I really would love to use the best practices in everything I do, and I don't think i fully took advantage of the flexbox suite at all, however, it does work.

## Second commit - Making random info section

This went better than the first one, however, I did find a very good stackoverflow [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22592064/how-to-align-text-below-an-image-in-css). The first answer with the jsfiddle link was my saviour to figure out how to align the text properly underneath the image boxes.

I still feel like the code can be much cleaner and that it is quite messy. And I also feel like I don't fully understand exactly why I defined certain things, however, I am gaining a much better understanding of the display types now.

Still a long way to go.

## Third commit - Making the quote section

I have absolutely no idea how to line up the quote with the author like it's lined up in the image, I tried a lot of things but I just cant get it to work.

I suppose it's fine as is now and then I'll go back to it later maybe.

## Fourth commit - Making call to action section

I made it. It's not very well made, it is absolutely not responsive at all.

I know for a fact you can create stuff like this and make it responsive without a bunch of breakpoints, however, I can't seem to be able to do that yet.
