# First commit - Making Hero

Styling to me seems like it's very badly done, I've tried using flexbox but it isn't responsive, I know it says not to worry about that, but just lining up the two columns with the image and hero text felt like I've done it extremely poorly and hard-coded like.

I really would love to use the best practices in everything I do, and I don't think i fully took advantage of the flexbox suite at all, however, it does work.
